Example Scenario Application
Consider a company deciding between multiple cloud and multi-cloud strategies:

Inventory and Dependency Mapping reveals that critical customer-facing applications have complex dependencies and high availability requirements.
Suitability Analysis indicates that these applications would benefit from high-performance compute and advanced AI services available on Cloud A but require robust data analytics from Cloud B.
Decision Tree analysis shows that placing these applications in different clouds would optimize performance but could complicate management.
Service Catalog evaluation highlights that Cloud A offers superior AI services while Cloud B excels in data analytics and regional compliance.
Migration Factory Structure ensures a streamlined migration process with clear governance, supporting operations across both clouds.
Outcome:

Multiple Cloud Strategy: Place AI-intensive applications in Cloud A and data analytics workloads in Cloud B, leveraging each cloudâ€™s strengths but managing them independently.
Multi-Cloud Strategy: Integrate and manage applications across both clouds, using a unified management layer to optimize performance and resource utilization while maintaining interoperability and governance.
This detailed analysis enables informed decision-making, balancing performance, cost, risk, and operational efficiency to choose the most suitable cloud strategy.
